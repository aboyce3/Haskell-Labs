Exercise 1  (Total 60 point)

(a).  (20 point)

Consider the following function j:

> j      :: (Ord a) => [(a,a)] -> a -> [a]
> j xs x =   [ v  | (u,v) <- xs, u == x]

Rewrite the function by using the higher order function
map and filter. You may use lambda function in your answer.

*** Put your answer below. For codes, DO NOT FORGET to add the > symbol.

> j1      :: (Ord a) => [(a,a)] -> a -> [a]
> j1 xs x = map snd (filter (\(x',_) -> x' == x) xs)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b).  (20 point)

Consider the function drop (a function in Prelude) of type"

drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]

where drop n xs returns the suffix of xs after the first n
elements, or [] if n >= length xs.

Rewrite the function by using the higher order function
map and filter. You may use lambda function in your answer.

*** Put your answer below. For codes, DO NOT FORGET to add the > symbol.

> drop1 :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
> drop1 n xs | n >= length xs = []
>            | otherwise = map fst (filter (\(_,y) -> y >= n) (zip xs [0..]))

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c).  (20 point)

Consider the following function mapFuns which takes
a list of functions and apply them all to a particular argument.
We can define the function by recursion as follows:

> mapFuns      :: [a -> b] -> a -> [b]
> mapFuns [] x     =  []
> mapFuns (f:fs) x =  f x : mapFuns fs x

Rewrite the function by using the higher order function
map and filter. You may use lambda function in your answer.

mapFuns      :: [a -> b] -> a -> [b]

*** Put your answer below. For codes, DO NOT FORGET to add the > symbol.

> mapFuns1      :: [a -> b] -> a -> [b]
> mapFuns1 fs x = map (\f -> f x) fs


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 2 (Total 80 point)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sets are basic mathmatical objects we often use to build more sophisticated
mathematical objects. In this exercise, we will used a list to represent a set
and implement functions to perform basic set operations. Note that Sets
should be an instance of the class Eq.


(a)  Implement the union function (named as union1)

The union function returns the list union of the two lists. For
example,

main> "dog" `union` "cow"
"dogcw"

Duplicates, and elements of the first list, are removed from the
second list, but if the first list contains duplicates, so will
the result.

*** Put your answer below. For codes, DO NOT FORGET to add the > symbol.

> union1 :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
> union1 xs ys = xs ++ filter (\y -> not (elem y xs)) (nub ys)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)  Implement the intersect function (named as intersect1)

The intersect function takes the list intersection of two lists.
For example,

main> [1,2,3,4] `intersect` [2,4,6,8]
[2,4]
If the first list contains duplicates, so will the result.

main> [1,2,2,3,4] `intersect` [6,4,4,2]
[2,2,4]

*** Put your answer below. For codes, DO NOT FORGET to add the > symbol.

> intersect1 :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
> intersect1 xs ys = filter (\x -> (elem x ys)) xs


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c)  Implement the subseteq function (named as subseteq1)

The function will take two lists xs ys as input, returns True
if xs is a subset of ys. Otherwise, it returns false.

NoteL Follow the set definition. That is, xs is a subset of ys
if for any x in xs, x is also an element in ys.  Do not use other
functions (such as elem) from the library.

*** Put your answer below. For codes, DO NOT FORGET to add the > symbol.

> subseteq1 :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
> subseteq1 [] ys = True
> subseteq1 (x:xs) ys | subsetHelper x ys = subseteq1 xs ys
>                     | otherwise = False

> subsetHelper :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
> subsetHelper x [] = False
> subsetHelper x (y:ys) | x == y = True
>                       | otherwise = subsetHelper x ys

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) difference:

The difference function is list difference (non-associative). In the result of

difference xs ys

the first occurrence of each element of ys in turn (if any) has been removed
from xs. Thus

main> difference "Hello World!" "ell W"
"Hoorld!"

*** Put your answer below. For codes, DO NOT FORGET to add the > symbol.

> difference :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
> difference xs [] = xs
> difference [] ys = []
> difference xs (y:ys) | elem y xs = difference (differenceHelper xs y) ys
>                      | otherwise = difference xs ys

> differenceHelper :: Eq a => [a] -> a -> [a]
> differenceHelper [] _ = []
> differenceHelper (x:xs) y | y == x = xs
>                           | otherwise = x : differenceHelper xs y

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1

> halve :: Int -> [a] -> ([a],[a])
> halve k xs = ((take k xs),(drop k xs))

Question 2 (Feijens Notation)
Given the function evaluate qs [3, 4, 1, 4, 2].
Show your steps using Feijenâ€™s notation.

> qs :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
> qs [] = [] -- qs.1
> qs (x:xs) = qs sml ++ [x] ++ qs lrg --qs.2
>   where
>     sml = [s | s <- xs, s <= x]
>     lrg = [l | l <- xs, x < l]

Feijens notation for "evaluate qs [3, 4, 1, 4, 2]":

qs [3,4,1,4,2]
={qs. 2}
qs sml ++ [x] ++ qs lrg
={simplify}
qs [1,2] ++ [3] ++ qs [4,4]
={qs. 2}
(qs sml ++ [1] ++ qs lrg) ++ [3] ++ (qs sml ++ [4] ++ qs lrg)
= {simplify, qs. 1}
(qs [] ++ [1] ++ qs [2]) ++ [3] ++ (qs [] ++ [4] ++ qs [4])
= {qs. 2, simplify}
([] ++ [1] ++ (qs [] ++ [2] ++ qs [])) ++ [3] ++ ([] ++ [4] ++ (qs [] ++ [4] ++ qs []))
={qs. 1}
([] ++ [1] ++ ([] ++ [2] ++ [])) ++ [3] ++ ([] ++ [4] ++ ([] ++ [4] ++ []))
={++ is associative}
[] ++ [1] ++ [] ++ [2] ++ [] ++ [3] ++ [] ++ [4] ++ [] ++ [4] ++ []
={simplify}
[1,2,3,4,4]

Question 3

> elm :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
> elm x [] = False
> elm x (x':xs) | x == x' = True
>               | otherwise = elm x xs

Question 4

> replicate1 :: Int -> a -> [a]
> replicate1 k x = [x | _ <- [1..k]]

Question 5

> q5 :: (Ord a) => [(a,a)] -> a -> [a]
> q5 xs x = [v | (u,v) <- xs, u==x]

> answer :: (Ord a) => [(a,a)] -> a -> [a]
> answer xs x = map snd (filter (\(x',y) -> x == x') xs)
